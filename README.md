## Description 

This project aims to refactor **_Horiseon_**'s website so it can :  

- meets accessiblity standards making the website for the use of everyone.
- be optimized for search engines so easier to pop up during interner searches.  


To reach that goal, we have completed and reorganised parts of codes within html and css  by including HTML semantic, images descriptions, title and fonctionality to the navigation features.
